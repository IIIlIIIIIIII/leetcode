/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-from-all-buildings/
 *
 * You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings
 * in the shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down, left
 * and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:
 * 1. Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
 * 2. Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.
 * 3. Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.
 *
 * For example, given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an
 * obstacle at (0,2):
 * 1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
 * |   |   |   |   |
 * 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
 * |   |   |   |   |
 * 0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0
 * The point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total
 * travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.
 *
 * Note:
 * There will be at least one building. If it is not possible to build
 * such house according to the above rules, return -1.

    /* Key:
     * Keep an extra matrix counting total number of buildings each '0'
     * can reach, since a desired point should be able to reach all buildings.
     *
     * Other than that, just do naive BFS constructing a distance matrix for
     * each building. (Tried to save space by reusing any existing matrices
     * but won't be any better)
     *
     * O((m*n)^2) time, O(m*n) space
