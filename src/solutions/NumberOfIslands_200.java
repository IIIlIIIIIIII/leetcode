/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/
 *
 * Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of
 * islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting
 * adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges
 * of the grid are all surrounded by water.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * 11110
 * 11010
 * 11000
 * 00000
 * Answer: 1
 *
 * Example 2:
 * 11000
 * 11000
 * 00100
 * 00011
 * Answer: 3
